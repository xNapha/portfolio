### About Me

**Who am I?**

An aspiring software developer, I enjoy creating things
and admiring the finished product.

I began my journey in 2021, where I learnt python during
University, without much thought about making it a
career. As I continued to learn more and more I started
to wonder if I could be able to get a job without a
proper Undergraduate degree, which made me want to try
pursue a career in the field.

Besides that I'm reading One Piece for the nth time.
